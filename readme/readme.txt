Plugin for CudaText.
Allows to convert text (selected block, or entire text if nothing selected) using many codings (transformations).
Ported from StringEncode: https://github.com/colinta/SublimeStringEncode
Later more codings were added.

Codings:

- HTML entitize/deentitize: converts characters to their HTML entity (like "&nbsp;" for non-breakable space)
- XML entitize/deentitize: converts characters to their XML entity
- CSS escape/unescape
- Safe HTML entitize/deentitize: converts characters to their HTML entity, but preserves HTML reserved characters
